# MERN AnimeSearcher

Responsive anime searcher app built with express, mongoose, react and redux, with jwt-auth.

This app uses kitsu api as an anime database and my own api that links comments to a specific anime title, creates accounts and manages jwt-auth and stores users favorites to  mongoDB.
